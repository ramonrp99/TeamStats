# TeamStats

Web application to obtain game stats in League of Legends. It's designed for teams, so if you enter multiple summoner names, it will only show games they've played together. These results can be filtered by game mode and date.

This allows teams to quickly and easily know their game stats, avoiding having to manually save them in Excel, for example.
